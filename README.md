# Deciding-best-independant-variable-in-Multilinear-Regression
By using back propagation algorithm in Multilinear Regression

This is a Multilinear Regression model which is using Back Propagession algorithm.
Multilinear Regression is used to predict feature value of dependant variable based on no of independant variable.

The Buisness problem is:
Dataset consists of data of 50 startups which include  R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, State, Profit. Here profit is dependant variable and remaining all other coloumns are indepandant variable. Consider a scenario where VP firm have to invest money, so on what criteria they should invest.
