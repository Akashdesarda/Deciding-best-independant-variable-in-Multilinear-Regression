Step 1:State coloumn is categorical data so we have to create dummy variable for all three states and that to in encoding from.
This is done using sklearn package's library LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder(for seprating dummy variable labelling them 0,1)

Step 2: dataset is divided in two set, one for training set and other for test set in 40:10 ratio. This is done using sklearn 
package's train_test_split.

Step 3: Creating a regressor that will used to predict future valuse
