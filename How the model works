Step 1:State coloumn is categorical data so we have to create dummy variable for all three states and that to in encoding from.
This is done using sklearn package's library LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder(for seprating dummy variable labelling them 0,1)

Step 2: dataset is divided in two set, one for training set and other for test set in 40:10 ratio. This is done using sklearn 
package's train_test_split.

Step 3: Creating a regressor that will used to predict future values. This is done by using sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
X_train, y_train is uesd for traing which is later fitted in model.

Step 4: this is most important step. Here optimal coloumn is generated using statsmodels.formula.api. Elimination of coloumn is based on P-value.
I am considering significant valuse as 0.050. In each iteration coloumn having highest P-value is eliminated. (This is how the back 
propagation algorithm works.)

Conclusion: R&D is the most important factor, then is Marketing, Adminestrative, and state.
